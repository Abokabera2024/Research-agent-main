The\nproposed approach utilizes the well-known iterative Fourier transform algorithm (IFTA) to\ngenerate a phase-only CGH for valuable digital and/or physical documents. The generated\nCGH is then secured by binary phase randomization, which is implemented using the\nsymmetric encryption technique, exclusive OR (XOR). The reconstruction process for the\ncalculated secured CGHs varied slightly depending on whether the documents were digital\nor physical. For digital documents, reconstruction was performed using a symmetric\ndecryption key followed by an inverse Fourier transform (IFFT). On the other hand, the\nreconstruction of the physical document involved two additional processes: printing and\nscanning. To evaluate the quality of the digital reconstruction, the speckle signal-to-noise\nratio (SSNR) was estimated for both printed grayscale and binary CGHs. The security\nanalysis of the XOR-encrypted CGH was quantitatively evaluated to ensure the level of pro-\ntection against various cryptographic attacks such as plaintext and brute-force attacks. The\nresults revealed that the combination of phase CGHs and the XOR encryption/decryption\nprovides robust cryptographic protection for valuable documents, benefiting document\nsecurity and anti-counterfeiting.\nKeywords: computer-generated holograms; document security; anti-counterfeiting\n1. Introduction\nValuable documents have security features that make them more difficult to copy,\ncounterfeit, or alter. These documents are issued by government agencies, law enforcement,\nregulatory authorities, corporations, or financial institutions. The most common secured\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 https://doi.org/10.3390/s25082410\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 2 of 17\ndocuments with security features are identity and travel documents such as driving li-\ncenses, national identity cards, passports, debit or credit cards, travel visas, and banknotes.\nSuch documents are required in different applications to verify a person’s identity and\ncredentials. However, the progress in image processing and printing technologies has\nmade it easier to counterfeit and falsify documents. As a result, the identity documents\nwould become illegitimate because anyone could forge their identity. These fake IDs are\nwidely used and openly available on the global underground market, both online and\nphysically. Criminals, including fraudsters and terrorists, can use them to enter an area\ncovertly and carry out illegal activities without raising any red flags [1,2]. Therefore, the use\nof security techniques such as security threads, watermarks, cryptography, steganography,\nand electronic signatures is highly recommended for these valuable documents [ 3–6]. As\npart of the development of security procedures for valuable documents, digital security\nfeatures including barcodes [7] have been introduced to combat counterfeiting. Barcodes\ncan be represented in different forms, such as PDF417, DataMatrix, MaxiCode, Aztec, quick\nresponse (QR) code, etc. [ 8]. QR code [ 9] is a data representation technique that can be\ndecoded by an optical scanner and a mobile application. However, the storage environment\nfor printed paper with the QR code is not the same as the factory setting. Consequently,\nthe code can become dirty, corrupt, or damaged, making the scanning process unreliable.\nThese drawbacks show that the technology is not robust. Alternatively, holography is a\nwidely used technology in document security based on the recording of the amplitude and\nphase of an object [10] in the form of a hologram. The creation of these holograms has been\nreported by Yaroslavskii and Merzlyakov [11], Dallas [12], and Lee [13]. The most widely\nused hologram for document security is an optically variable device (OVD). OVD is an\niridescent or non-iridescent security feature that provides different information, such as\ncolor change or movement, that is affected by illumination and/or observation angle [14].\nConcerning the state of the art, iridescent OVDs can be classified into two main categories:\ndiffractive optically variable image devices (DOVIDs) and interference security image\nstructures (ISISs) [15]. DOVIDs contain micro- or nano-structures in the form of diffractive\ngratings that produce optically variable effects such as dynamic chromatic, holographic,\nkinematic, and 2D or 3D images that are easy to recognize [16]. DOVIDs can also contain\nelements that are invisible to the naked human eye, such as micro printing, kinetic effects,\nmicro text, or a variable laser-readable micro-image that is invisible under white light\nwhen magnified. The micro-image is known as the hidden image and is generated by\nincorporating a computer-generated hologram (CGH) into the DOVIDs [ 15]. Read-out\nof the additional CGH is done optically using coherent illumination. On the other hand,\nISISs are based on thin-film structures, which leads to a color change upon tilting the docu-\nment [17,18]. Thus, DOVID consists of adjacent fringes, whereas ISIS consists of one or more\nthin films. CGH, or digitally generated holographic interference patterns, is a technique\nthat uses numerical approaches to mimic the actual processes behind the optical recording\nand reconstruction of a real hologram. Therefore, it represents a major improvement over\nclassical holography [19]. According to the review in Ref. [ 20], this technique has been\nused to secure valuable documents in applications such as security printing and document\nauthentication. Using a sophisticated amplitude that is undetectable to the human eye but\nreadable under coherent light illumination, CGHs can encode images and digital data. Two\ntypes of holograms have been proposed for document security: photopolymer security\nholograms with integrated micro-CGHs [21] and printed holograms applied using thermal\nprinting, laser ablation, and office printers [20]. For authentication, the micro-CGHs can\ninclude individualized encoded data. It is often possible to decode the printed CGH data\nusing smartphone cameras based on numerical reconstruction techniques. The key advan-\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 3 of 17\ntages of CGHs for document security are their high level of security and their adaptability\nin encoding different types of data.\nPrevious studies [19,20,22,23] have used printed binary amplitude computer-generated\nholograms (CGHs). In holography, however, the phase distribution carries most of the in-\nformation. Encoding the phase using binary amplitude is challenging because it introduces\nambiguity, requiring a higher space–bandwidth product (SBP) to accurately represent the\nphase. This is particularly problematic in applications such as secure document authentica-\ntion, where the SBP is inherently limited, restricting the performance of binary amplitude\nCGHs in faithfully encoding the information to be encrypted.\nImage-encryption techniques have been proposed in the literature based on various\nmethods. The utilization of chaotic systems in cryptography attracted the attention of a\nlarge number of researchers due to their sensitivity to initial conditions (butterfly effect),\nnon-linearity, the fact that the initial parameters act as the encryption key, and unpre-\ndictability [24–26]. However, they are too complex to use because of their computational\ncomplexity, intensive memory requirements, and high sensitivity to key values, which can\nlead to decryption failure. Alternatively, the exclusive OR (XOR) encryption/decryption\ntechnique might be employed due to its simplicity and speed.\nTherefore, in the current study, we aim to explore a novel approach for securing\nvaluable digital and/or physical documents such as a driver’s license and the bio-data\npage of a passport. The proposed approach uses a binary phase-only CGH to overcome\nthe drawbacks of using an amplitude hologram. In addition, the generated CGH is mod-\nified by modulating it with a random phase mask using the well-known XOR encryp-\ntion/decryption technique to add a layer of protection. Thus, the proposed approach is\nachieved via hologram generation, XOR encryption/decryption processes, and reconstruc-\ntion. The integration of hologram generation with XOR encryption/decryption provides\nrobust cryptographic protection for valuable documents, a method that, to our knowledge,\nhas not been used before. Unlike the purely cryptographic layer of chaotic methods, the\nintegration of XOR with the CGH provides a hybrid security approach that combines\ncryptographic encryption with holographic phase encoding. This complementary approach\nensures compatibility with standard printers/scanners without the need for specialized\nhardware. The proposed method and its evaluation are presented and discussed in the\nfollowing sections.\n2. Phase-Only Hologram Generation\nCGHs encode arbitrary wavefields, amplitude, and phase information, using a com-\nputer to mathematically model the interference patterns obtained by superimposing the\nwavefield diffracted by an object and a known reference wave at the hologram plane. Based\non numerical propagation between the object and hologram planes, the phase information\ncomputed at the hologram plane can be converted to a wavefield with an intensity that\napproximates the desired object when reconstructed. This allows encrypted document\nimages, the intensity of the wavefield at the object plane, to be securely transmitted and\nretrieved using holographic techniques. Accurate numerical reconstruction algorithms are\nessential to authentically represent the details of the original input image. The flowchart\nin Figure 1 demonstrates the procedure used for calculating a phase-only CGH using the\nwell-known IFTA (which refers to the Gerchberg–Saxton (G-S) algorithm) [27,28].\nIt should be noted that we chose the well-known G-S algorithm for CGH generation\nbecause it is a reliable and widely recognized method for encoding valuable information\nin holographic data. Despite being an established approach, the G-S algorithm remains\nhighly effective due to its iterative nature and ease of implementation. Furthermore, its\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 4 of 17\nwidespread use in similar contexts ensures that our results are reproducible and consistent\nwith existing research in diffractive optics and holographic projection applications.\nFigure 1. Schematic flowchart for generating a phase-only CGH using IFTA. Note that the red boxes\ncorrespond to operations performed at the object plane, while the blue boxes correspond to operations\nperformed at the hologram plane.\nThe IFTA approach uses the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its inversion (IFFT) for\nforward and backward propagation between two planes, using the predefined intensities\nacross these planes as constraints [11,29,30]. This inverse problem is then solved iteratively\nas follows, starting with a complex-valued object (U(0)\n0 ), with an initial phase estimate\nϕ(0)\n0 = 0 and an amplitude A0 =\n√\nI, where I is its intensity constraint applied at the object\nplane, i.e., the information to encode as an image, which can be expressed as follows:\nU0(0) = A0 · exp\nh\niϕ0(0)\ni\n. (1)\nThe diffracted field at the hologram plane (U(n)\nh ) is estimated by propagating the\nobject field, (U(0)\n0 ) given by Equation (1), using the FFT expressed by the operator (F) in\nthe following:\nU(n)\nh = F\nn\nU(n)\n0\no\n. (2)\nAt this plane, the second amplitude constraint is applied (i.e., assuming a plane wave\nillumination Ah = 1) while maintaining the same phase ( ϕ(n)\nh ), which is estimated by\ndividing the complex function U(n)\nh by its amplitude |U(n)\nh |. The wavefield at the hologram\nplane can be written by modifying Equation (2) as follows:\nU′\nh\n(n) = Ah · exp\nh\niϕ(n)\nh\ni\n. (3)\nThen, the back propagation to the object plane is performed by applying the IFFT\nexpressed by the operator (F−1) to Equation (3), resulting in the following:\nU0(n+1) = F−1\nn\nU\n′\nh\n(n)\no\n. (4)\nThus, Equation (4) gives the wavefield at the object plane for the next iteration, i.e.,\nn + 1. Here, iteration n + 1 is started by reapplying the amplitude constraint (i.e., replacing\nthe original object amplitude A0) while keeping the same phase (ϕ(n+1)\n0 ). The generated\nwavefield can be expressed in Equation (5) as follows:\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 5 of 17\nU\n′\n0\n(n+1)\n= A0 · exp\nh\niϕ(n+1)\n0\ni\n. (5)\nThe iteration procedure is repeated until no change in phase is observed or a prede-\nfined condition (ϕ(n+1)\nh − ϕ(n)\nh ≤ ϵ) is satisfied.\nIn the current study, the CGHs were generated from grayscale images. This can be\nattributed to three reasons: (i) practical compatibility, (ii) computational efficiency, and (iii)\nstandardization. (i) Practical compatibility: most laser printers and scanners are commonly\noptimized for monochrome/grayscale output, ensuring reliable binarization and recon-\nstruction. (ii) Computational efficiency: grayscale CGHs reduce computational complexity\nby 3× compared to RGB-based holograms, which require separate phase calculations for\neach color channel. (iii) Standardization: security features like MRZ text and signatures are\ntypically monochrome in official documents, aligning with grayscale encoding. It should be\nnoted that several propagation operators based on Fresnel and plane wave compensation\ncan also be used [31,32]. In addition, the hologram itself could be modulated within the\nhologram generation step, employing spatial multiplexing, analogous to [33], to encode\nmultiple pages of information in a single CGH. In the current study, the CGH generation\nand reconstruction processes were implemented using MATLAB R2021a for numerical\nsimulations and PyCharm Professional 2023.2 for developing a user-friendly graphical\ninterface. The generation process involves calculating the CGHs using IFTA, in addition to\nthe XOR encryption for securing the calculated CGH. On the other hand, the reconstruction\nprocess includes the reconstruction of the calculated CGHs using inverse IFTA along with\nXOR decryption. It is worth mentioning that the elapsed time of generating and recon-\nstructing the CGH is highly influenced by the specifications of the used central processing\nunit (CPU). In the current study, the calculation time required to generate the CGH after\n100 iterations using CoreTM i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50 GHz with 4 GB RAM, operating system\nWindows 10 pro-64-bit, was 3.98 s, and the elapsed time for the XOR encryption was 0.20 s.\nOn the other hand, the reconstruction time for CGH, including the XOR decryption step,\nwas 1.55 s.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe proposed method for securing valuable documents covers both digital and phys-\nical formats. For both types, document security is achieved by generating a CGH and\nadding an extra layer of protection through randomization with a binary phase mask.\nThis randomization can be implemented using basic symmetric encryption techniques\nsuch as XOR. Although XOR is a basic encryption technique and may be vulnerable to\nattack, the use of a long randomized encryption key makes it able to deter this type of attack.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the combination of CGH and XOR encryption/decryption\noffers a strong cryptographic protection method that has not been applied to valuable\ndocuments. To decrypt the secured CGH, one must first apply XOR decryption, followed\nby an IFFT.\nThe proposed approach for adding a layer of protection to binary CGH is based on\nintegrating it with encryption and decryption using the XOR operation that is part of\nsymmetric key encryption. This ensures that the same key used for encryption is also used\nfor decryption, which is a simple and effective way of protecting image data. If we assume\nthat the binary image, represented as I[m, n], is then XORed with a generated binary key\nK[m, n] of the same dimensions, m and n, then the encryption is mathematically described\nas follows:\nIenc [m, n] =I[m, n] ⊕ K[m, n] . (6)\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 6 of 17\nIn Equation (6), Ienc [n, m] is the encrypted binary CGH and ⊕ refers to the XOR\noperation applied to each pixel according to the basics of the XOR operation. Decryption\nis then performed by applying the XOR decryption algorithm, this time between the\nencrypted CGH image Ienc [m, n] and the original key K[m, n] as the decrypted key. This\nprocess is described as follows:\nIdec [m, n] =Ienc [m, n] ⊕ K[m, n] . (7)\nThe operation given in Equation (7) restores the optimal distribution to the original\nencrypted binary CGH, I(x, y). The decrypted CGH image is then stored and can be\nvisually compared to the original image to confirm the accuracy of the process. This\nmethod is particularly valuable for binary images such as CGH due to its simplicity and\nability to effectively secure data with minimal computational overhead.\n3.1. Secured CGH of a Digital Document\nFor validating the proposed method, a template of a designed digital driving license\nwas tested. A digital driving license is one of the commonly used documents to authenticate\nthe identity of a license holder [34].\n3.1.1. CGH Generation of Digital Documents\nThe simulation of replacing the commonly used QR code with a CGH in a designed\ndigital driver’s license is shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2a, the QR code is used as\na security feature. However, reading the dynamic QR code requires an internet connection\nfor authentication. Therefore, instead of the QR code, CGH can be used to secure the\nextracted region of interest in Figure 2b, as depicted in Figure 2c. The CGH is computed for\nthe full data image shown in Figure 2b.\nFigure 2. (a) A designed template of a digital driver’s license with a QR code and size of\n1730 × 1060 pixels. ( b) The driver’s license after removing the QR code and ( c) replacing the QR\ncode with the CGH of the image in ( b). Note that the actual size of the CGH image in ( c) is\n1730 × 1060 pixels.\nThe QR code is used to store specific information from the digital document, i.e., text\nand/or numbers, but it cannot store an image due to its limited data storage. In contrast,\nCGH can store text, numbers, and the full image of a document. The authentication process\nof the driving license containing a dynamic QR code requires an internet connection.\nThe advantage of using CGH instead of the QR code is its ability to store a vast bundle\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 7 of 17\nof data (i.e., full image storage) and the verification of identity without the need for a\ndatabase connection to retrieve and compare the data as with the QR code. Additionally,\nthe CGH-encoded data can be retrieved offline.\n3.1.2. XOR Encryption\nIn addition, an extra layer of protection was added to the binary computed CGH using\none of the basic symmetric cryptographic XOR techniques [ 35]. It is worth noting that\nalthough the XOR method is a basic symmetric cryptographic technique, it was chosen\nfor its practicality and efficiency in implementing an additional layer of protection for the\ncomputed CGH. This method has several advantages that make it superior for securing\nthe CGH. It can be used for real-time document verification with minimal computational\ncost. In addition, the use of a long, randomly generated encryption key enhances security\nby making the encryption difficult to break. Combined with the CGH, XOR provides an\neffective layer of protection for valuable documents against unauthorized access.\nBecause XOR encryption works with binary data, it is particularly useful for process-\ning digital images commonly encoded in binary format. In this method, each binary bit\nof the matrix of the binary CGH matrix is XORed with a corresponding bit of a binary\nkey. By comparing each pair of bits, the XOR process creates a ciphertext that hides the\noriginal image data (encryption process). The XOR operation on the ciphertext is per-\nformed with the same unique key during the decryption process (reserving the encryption\nprocess), as demonstrated in Table 1, revealing the original CGH image. Thus, the XOR\nencryption/decryption process is easy to use, computationally efficient, and provides an\nadditional protection layer to the computed CGH.\nTable 1. Example of encryption and decryption of binary CGH matrix row using XOR technique\nwith symmetric encryption and decryption key. The table shows all the steps required to encrypt the\nrow, the encryption/decryption key used, the resulting encryption, referred to as the Cipher matrix,\nand the result of the decryption, referred to as the Plain text matrix. Note that these operations are\nperformed based on the model described by Equations (6) and (7).\nMatrix of binary CGH image 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\nEncryption key 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\nCipher matrix 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\nDecryption key 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1\nPlain matrix 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\nThere are several advantages of using XOR encryption to secure CGH images. The con-\nfidentiality of CGH images is enhanced by XOR encryption, which provides a quick/fast\nand easy way to obfuscate image data. Furthermore, because XOR operations are com-\nputationally efficient, they can effectively encrypt large amounts of image data without\nacquiring significant processing overhead. Similarly, XOR encryption is easy to integrate\nand deploy in current systems or software used for CGH generation processing. Despite its\nsimplicity, XOR encryption can offer a basic level of security for CGH images, particularly\nif a suitably long, strong, and randomly generated encryption key is used. It should be\nnoted that integrating the encryption key into CGH does not change the amount of storage\nrequired, as the result of this process is also a 1-bit image with the same resolution.\n3.1.3. Security Analysis of XOR-Encrypted CGH\nTo assess the security strength against cryptographic attacks, we used entropy analysis,\nmeasurements of horizontal correlation, the number of pixels change rate (NPCR), and\nunified average changing intensity (UACI) [36], as shown in Table 2.\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 8 of 17\nTable 2. Statistical security tests for the original and XOR-encrypted CGHs using different metrics:\nentropy, horizontal correlation, number of pixels change rate (NPCR), and unified average changing\nintensity (UACI).\nMetric Original Image Encrypted Image 1 Encrypted Image 2\nEntropy 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000\nHorizontal correlation 0.3579 −0.0012 0.0010\nNPCR (number of pixels change rate) % - 50.0338 50.0338\nUACI (unified average changing intensity) % - 50.0338 50.0338\nEntropy Analysis\nThe measurement of cryptographic image security against attacks relies on entropy.\nThe entropy is defined as how randomly distributed the pixel values are in an encrypted\nCGH image, where higher entropy indicates better randomization of the encoded data,\nmaking it is difficult for attackers to identify or predict the statistical pattern required to\nretrieve the original information. This analysis was applied to two different encrypted\nimages (image 1 and image 2), as shown in Table 2. Both images reveal high entropy values\nof (1). The results obtained ensure robust protection against statistical attacks.\nCorrelation Coefficient Analysis\nThe relationships between pixels were assessed using the correlation coefficient. When\nthe images lack encryption, the structural elements of pixel arrays create strong links\nbetween adjacent pixels. In contrast, during the encryption process, the relationship\nbetween the pixels is greatly reduced. As illustrated in Table 2, a low correlation of−0.0012\nand 0.0010 was obtained between the original image and the encrypted two images (i.e.,\nimage 1 and image 2), which ensures difficulty for attackers trying to retrieve the original\ninformation.\nNPCR and UACI Analysis\nEvaluation of the sensitivity of the encryption process to small changes in the plaintext\nimage depends on the NPCR and UACI metrics depicted in Table 2. The NPCR determines\nthe proportion of pixel change in the corresponding encrypted images from nearly identical\noriginal images. UACI analyses average intensity differences. A perfect encryption system\nof a grayscale image achieves an NPCR threshold of 99%, meaning that each input pixel\nresponds differently to small adjustments in the original image. For binary CGH images,\nan XOR encryption process produces an expected NPCR rate of 50% because pixels exist in\na two-state system between 0 and 1. The NPCR for the two encrypted images (i.e., image 1\nand image 2) is 50.0338%, demonstrating the correct functioning of the diffusion process. A\nUACI value of 50.0338% shows that minimal changes in plaintext will produce substantially\ndifferent ciphertext values.\nSecurity Implications Against Brute-Force Attacks\nBrute-force attack is a hacking technique that involves repeatedly trying different com-\nbinations of encryption keys until the correct one can be obtained. Although our proposed\nalgorithm was based on XOR encryption, which is easy to implement and has poor crypto-\ngraphic protection, we used two mechanisms to make it more resistant to such attacks. Such\nmechanisms involve the addition of salt to the master key and spatial shuffling. The master\nsecurity key was generated from Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)\nusing Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit that performs 1000 iterations for generating 128-bit\ncryptographic salt. For the CGH with a size of M × N pixels, the spatial shuffling generates\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 9 of 17\nM × N possible shuffles that combine with the 256-bit key space and contribute 2256 po-\ntential combinations. Let us assume that the attacker has a supercomputer that can check\n1018 keys per second, which is optimistic. Therefore, the attacker will need 3.7 × 1051 years\nto complete the decryption process. These two procedures strengthen the security against\nbrute-force attacks, making it extremely challenging for attackers to simultaneously break\nboth the generated salt and the spatial shuffling of the XOR-encrypted CGH.\n3.1.4. CGH Decryption and Reconstruction of Digital Documents\nBefore starting the reconstruction process of the encrypted CGH image, the XOR\ndecryption key should be applied to decrypt the encrypted CGH image. This process\nis called decryption. Based on Equation (7), the XOR decryption step performs XOR\ndecryption between the secured binary CGH and the original encryption key. Hence, the\noriginal binary CGH will be retrieved. Consequently, another process was applied, which\nis called reconstruction. This process involves applying IFFT to the binary decrypted CGH\nto obtain the original image of the valuable document. Both processes, i.e., decryption and\nreconstruction, are demonstrated in Figure 3. The results of the reconstruction show that\nthe encoded license information can only be fully retrieved with good quality if the correct\nencryption key is used to decrypt the secured CGH.\nFigure 3. (a) The reconstruction process of digital driver’s license CGH without applying the\ndecryption process and (b) the decryption process followed by the reconstruction process. Note that\nin (a), the reconstruction does not provide any information about the encoded license, while in (b),\none can retrieve all encoded license information. It is noted that the size of the driver’s license and\nCGH images is 1730 × 1060 pixels.\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 10 of 17\n3.2. Secured CGH of a Physical Document\nOn the other hand, the process of securing a physical document involves more steps,\nas shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. Flowchart of the procedure of securing valuable physical documents using the combination\nof CGH and XOR encryption/decryption.\n3.2.1. CGH Generation of Physical Documents\nThe calculated phase-only CGH using IFTA for securing a valuable document is\nobtained as a grayscale image with values ranging from 0 to 255. To overcome the resolution\nlimitations of the used printers and the limited pixel size, the CGH is binarized using Otsu’s\nmethod [37], resulting in a matrix of 0 and 1 values. To increase the security of the binarized\nCGH, a protection step is introduced by randomizing it using the XOR encryption key.\nThe encrypted CGH is then printed on secured or standard office paper. Once printed,\nthe secured CGH can be captured with a smartphone camera or scanned with a scanner,\nthen binarized. The final step in securing the valuable physical document is to numerically\nreconstruct the image. This process requires the application of the XOR decryption key\nwith the original encryption key, followed by an IFFT to obtain the best approximation\nof the original input image. Please note that when configuring the printing process, it is\nessential to ensure that there is no scaling or difference in resolution between the printed\nand scanned images of the secured CGH.\nWe examined safeguarding the bio-data page information of a passport, as delineated\nby the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This is done by\nextracting specific data fields from the passport image, such as the passport number, expi-\nration date, passport holder image, signature, or name of the passport holder. Additionally,\nthe bio-data page of the passport and/or the entire image of the machine-readable zone\n(MRZ) can be captured and encrypted as CGH.\nThe process of generating CGHs for selected parts of the bio-data page of a designed\npassport template is shown in Figure 5. The chosen parts used for calculating CGHs are\nthe personal photograph, the signature of the passport holder, and the MRZ. The CGH of\neach selected part of the passport (shown in Figure 5a) was calculated using the IFTA. The\nCGH can be generated for the entire bio-data page, as depicted in Figure 5b.\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 11 of 17\nFigure 5. (a) A designed passport bio-data page with a size of 1270 × 1870 pixels and selected regions\nof interest to calculate their CGHs. (b) The CGH of the full bio-data page with a size of1270 × 1870 pixels.\n3.2.2. Printing of the CGH\nGrayscale CGH\nA monochrome laser printer was used to print different sizes of generated grayscale\nCGHs. Grayscale CGH is an image represented in 8 bits, which means that it uses 256 (28)\ngrayscale values ranging from 0 (corresponding to black color) to 255 (corresponding to\nwhite color). The potential problem with printed grayscale CGH images is the low contrast\nratio. This arises from the printer’s difficulty in achieving sharp distinctions between\ndifferent grayscale levels, resulting in a washed-out or unclear appearance. This also makes\nit sensitive to noise during scanning, such as dust and uneven lighting. The noise during the\nscanning process arises from dust particles that may settle on the document or scanner; they\nobscure small portions of the printed CGH. This results in the introduction of unintended\n“black spots” or “voids” in the scanned image, which distort the reconstruction process.\nAdditionally, uneven lighting while using a scanner or a smart phone camera causes the\ntested document to reflect too much light; this introduces variations in pixel intensities\nthat are unrelated to the actual hologram pattern, effectively adding random noise to the\nCGH. This in turn leads to poor numerical reconstruction of these CGHs. This problem is\ndemonstrated in Section 3.3 showing the degradation of the reconstructed image.\nTherefore, to overcome these drawbacks, the CGH should be converted into a binary\none during the computation process.\nBinarized CGH\nBinarization is performed during the CGH calculation. This was achieved using\nthe Otsu threshold technique [ 38,39]. This method is an automatic image thresholding\ntechnique in which the histogram of the grayscale CGH is calculated. This is then iterated\nfor all threshold values from 0 to 255. For each threshold, the histogram was divided\ninto two classes of pixels: pixels with intensities below the selected threshold value and\npixels above the selected threshold. Hence, the variance between the two classes should be\nestimated for each threshold. The maximum variance between the two classes is chosen as\nthe appropriate value to obtain the best separation between the two classes. Finally, based\non the selected threshold value, the pixels below the threshold are set to 0 (black), and the\npixels above the threshold value are set to 1 (white). A binarized phase-only CGH offers\nan advantage over a grayscale one due to its higher contrast ratio. This is because laser\nprinters use a laser to selectively charge the drum, enabling toner to adhere only to the\nexposed areas through charge neutralization [40]. The difference between the presence and\nabsence of toner on the surface of the drum is more pronounced than the thin variations\nin grayscale intensity. The higher the contrast, the sharper the image, and this affects the\nscanning processing of printed images when illuminated during the scanning process. The\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 12 of 17\nscanning process, based on light, triggers the document, then the reflected light indicates\nthe presence or absence of toner on the surface of the paper, which is easier to detect in\nbinary images than in grayscale images.\nThe binarization process reduces the storage space of the 8-bit CGH to one-eighth,\nwhich could be an advantage. However, it also reduces the bandwidth product of the gray\nCGH to one-eighth [ 41], introducing quantization errors. These errors appear as noise\nin the background and reduce the contrast of the reconstructed encoded information. In\naddition, the quality of the holographic reconstruction is affected by the reduction of the\nbandwidth product by one-eighth due to binarization [42]. However, we mitigated this\ndegradation by applying a low-pass filter to suppress these artifacts and to improve the\nvisual quality in terms of contrast and SNR of the reconstruction, similar to [43,44]. Despite\nthese trade-offs, binarization simplifies the encryption process, making it more efficient and\nsecure. Moreover, it enhances compatibility with the printing and imaging stages, allowing\nfor seamless integration into document security.\nOn the other hand, conversion of the grayscale image to a binary image reduces the\nspeckle noise, which is a common error that can occur during the reconstruction of the CGH,\nresulting in a cleaner and more consistent reconstructed image. Despite the advantages\nof binarization, there is a serious drawback, which is the formation of double-overlapped\nimages during reconstruction. To overcome this problem, the CGH generation code has\nbeen modified. The modification can be made in one of two ways to overcome this obstacle.\nFirst, the modification of CGH during the generation process is a linear phase, i.e., a ramp.\nSecond, a zero-padding image is created to become the base of the input image.\n3.2.3. Scanning of the Printed CGH\nThe printed CGHs were scanned using two different methods, i.e., a mobile phone\ncamera and a scanner. The camera of a Xiaomi Poco X3 NFC (Xiaomi, Beijing, China)\nsmartphone with specifications of Android 12, MIUI 14.0.2, 64 MP , f/1.9, (wide),1/1.73′′,\n0.8 µm, PDAF, 13 MP , f/2.2,119◦ (ultrawide), 1.0 µm, 2 MP , f/2.4, (macro), 2 MP , f/2.4,\n(depth), dual-LED flash, HDR, and panorama was used to capture the printed CGHs. Each\nCGH was captured with different modes: photo AI, original document, black and white\ndocument, and enhanced document. It should be noted that the images captured by the\nmobile phone in these different modes had a bit depth of 24 bits and were represented as\ncolored images (RGB). On the other hand, an optical scanner model HP ScanJet Pro 2500\nf1 (HP, Beijing, China) accurately captures text from documents for easy editing with HP\nScan and I.R.I.S. Readiris™ Pro OCR software (HP, China) producing sharp, true-to-life\nscans of documents, graphics, and photos at up to 1200 dpi resolution. It has been used to\nscan printed CGHs on paper. The scanning process can be in either color or monochrome\nmodes. The scanned image produces a bit depth of 8 and 24 bits in the color mode. In the\nmonochrome mode, the bit depth is 1 bit. Therefore, in our case, it was preferable to use\nthe monochrome mode rather than the color mode. This is because the image captured\nwith the monochrome mode is a 1-bit binary image, so it does not need to be re-binarized\nafter capture but is directly subjected to reconstruction. However, images scanned using\nthe color mode and those captured by a smartphone camera must be binarized before the\nnumerical reconstruction to remove noise for better reconstruction.\n3.2.4. CGH Reconstruction of Physical Documents\nAn essential step after capturing the CGH image of a physical document, either\nwith a mobile camera or a scanner operating in color mode, is the binarization process.\nBinarization is the process of converting the captured or scanned images into black and\nwhite pixels, removing background variations and irregularities in lighting. This, in turn,\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 13 of 17\nmakes it easier to distinguish between text or features of interest and background. As a\nresult, the quality of the numerical reconstruction of the physical documents is improved.\nThe flowchart of the CGH reconstruction of the physical documents is shown in Figure 6. It\nis worth mentioning that the captured 1-bit image did not need to be binarized because\nits pixels already had values of (0,1). In addition, the MRZ intensity reconstruction is\nmodulated with an intensity envelope function, i.e., the center is brighter than the image\nsides, derived from the Fourier transform of a window function. Finally, the reconstruction\nis modulated with a sinc function, which is used as described in [45] because of the limited\npixel size.\nFigure 6. The procedure of generating and reconstructing the MRZ image of a designed passport\nbio-data page of a physical document. Note that the MRZ image is resized to 200 × 600 pixels before\nCGH generation, the actual size of the printed CGH is 1 × 4 inches (25 mm × 100 mm) (600 dpi), and\nthe printed CGH is scanned by a 600 dpi scanner.\nOne of the most common document security features used worldwide is the smart\nchip. The smart chip is typically embedded within the cover or one of the inner pages of\nbiometric passports. It contains the holder’s biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial\nrecognition, and iris patterns, along with other identifying information, and it plays a\ncrucial role in authentication during border control. Smart chips are often difficult to access,\nbut in cases of forgery, fraudsters may attempt to tamper with or physically destroy the\nchip to prevent electronic verification. However, smart chips are relatively expensive to\nproduce and integrate into documents.\nAlternatively, CGH offers the storage of photos, text, and numbers like a smart chip\nbut at a lower cost, and they can be accessed offline. Furthermore, it can be reconstructed\neven if part of it is cut off. Therefore, CGH can be used as an effective tool in place of a\nsmart chip.\n3.3. Factors Affecting the Quality of the Reconstruction\nThe quality of the digital reconstruction of a physical document was evaluated based\non the printing resolution and the size of the printed CGH. First, we tested the quality\nof the reconstruction of printed grayscale CGH with a printing resolution of 600 dpi. As\nmentioned in “Section Grayscale CGH”, the reconstruction quality of the printed grayscale\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 14 of 17\nCGH is quite low, as shown in Figure 7. Then, we tested the quality of the printed\nbinary CGHs.\nTo achieve this, the computed CGHs were printed on white paper at two resolutions\n(300 dpi and 600 dpi), and each resolution was scaled to different sizes (1 inch, 2 inches,\nand 3 inches). The effect of changing the printing resolution and the size of the CGH is\nshown in Figure 7. The quality of the numerical reconstruction for each case was assessed\nquantitatively by estimating the speckle signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR). The SSNR is defined\nas the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean pixel intensity within a region of interest.\nIt is often used as a measure of the speckle noise level relative to the signal strength within\nthat region. A higher SSNR indicates a stronger signal relative to the noise. Figure 8\nshows the estimated SSNR for the two printing resolutions (300 dpi and 600 dpi) with\ndifferent sizes (1 inch, 2 inches, and 3 inches). The results show that the reconstruction of\nthe grayscale CGH that had a size of 3 inches (600 dpi) gave the worst SSNR (0.3469), while\nthe reconstruction of the binary CGH with a resolution of 600 dpi and a size of 3 inches\nyielded the best SSNR (0.7021).\nThis indicates that the recommended criteria for obtaining adequate reconstruction\nquality is that the binary form of CGH should be used for printing and scanning, with a\nsize starting from 2 inches and a resolution of 600 dpi. This proves that a direct relationship\nexists between the printing size, resolution, and form of the CGH image and the quality of\nthe numerical reconstruction of the CGH.\nFigure 7. The procedure for generating and reconstructing a CGH of a designed passport number\nof a physical document. Note that the passport image is resized to 600 × 600 pixels before CGH\ngeneration, the actual size of the printed CGH is 2 inches (50 mm× 50 mm) (600 dpi), and the printed\nCGH is scanned using a 600 dpi scanner.\nFigure 8. The estimated values of the speckle signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) for (a) the grayscale versus\nbinary CGHs at 3 inches (600 dpi) and (b) the binary CGH with different sizes (1 inch, 2 inches, and\n3 inches) at 300 dpi and 600 dpi.\nSensors 2025, 25, 2410 15 of 17\n4. Conclusions\nA new CGH-based approach for securing valuable physical and digital documents\nhas been proposed. The method uses IFTA integrated with the XOR encryption process to\ngenerate a phase-only CGH for a document of interest. The obtained grayscale CGH was\nconverted to a binary one to evaluate the quality of digital reconstruction of both grayscale\nand binary forms in terms of SSNR. The reconstruction process of the calculated CGH\nwas performed via IFFT followed by XOR decryption. The results show that the binary\nCGH has a better reconstruction quality than the grayscale one. In addition, the effect of\nchanging the printing size and the resolution of the printed CGH was investigated, showing\na significant improvement in reconstruction results with increasing printed hologram size.\nMoreover, the security strength against cryptographic attacks was evaluated using entropy,\nhorizontal correlation, NPCR, and UACI, revealing robust protection against brute-force\nattacks. In conclusion, our proposed method provides a practical and reliable solution\nfor the security of valuable documents. This overcomes the limitations of other storage\nmethods like QR codes. The integration of XOR encryption and decryption processes\nwith the calculated CGH enhances data confidentiality and integrity. Furthermore, our\napproach is cost-effective and can be implemented using commonly available devices such\nas office laser printers, smartphones, and scanners, eliminating the need for specialized\nholographic equipment. This accessibility makes CGH-based security features more widely\naccepted, enabling various entities such as corporations, individuals, governments, and\norganizations to enhance the security of their important documents. Reducing the risks\nassociated with counterfeiting, forgery, and unauthorized access ultimately contributes to\nthe achievement of the SDGs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.E.A., R.M.A. and M.A.; data curation, Z.E.A. and R.M.A.;\ninvestigation, Y.A.A., M.A. and C.F.; methodology, M.A. and C.F.; validation, Z.E.A., M.A. and C.F.;\nvisualization, Z.E.A., R.M.A. and M.A.; formal analysis, M.A., C.F. and R.B.B.; writing—original draft,\nZ.E.A., R.M.A. and M.A.; writing—review and editing, M.A., C.F. and R.B.B.; project administration,\nM.A.; funding acquisition, T.A.K., M.A. and R.B.B.; supervision, R.M.A., Y.A.A., T.A.K. and M.A. All\nauthors have read and agreed to the submitted version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the project\n“Securing valuable documents using computer generated holograms printed with photochromic inks”\n(Secret-CGH, project no. 536608072).\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made\navailable by the authors upon request.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n1.

The effect of changing the printing resolution and the size of the CGH is\\nshown in Figure 7.\\n\\nThe quality of the numerical reconstruction for each case was assessed\\nquantitatively by estimating the speckle signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR). The SSNR is defined\\nas the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean pixel intensity within a region of interest. It is often used as a measure of the speckle noise level relative to the signal strength within\\nthat region. A higher SSNR indicates a stronger signal relative to the noise.
