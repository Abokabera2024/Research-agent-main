# Stage 8: LangGraph Nodes Implementation

## Overview
This stage implements the individual processing nodes that form the LangGraph pipeline for document analysis.

## Core Nodes

### Document Ingestion Node
- Loads PDF documents and extracts text
- Assigns document IDs for tracking
- Handles file validation and error recovery

### Text Processing Node
- Chunks text into manageable segments
- Creates embeddings and stores in vector database
- Prepares data for retrieval

### Retrieval Node
- Performs semantic search based on queries
- Retrieves relevant document chunks
- Maintains context and metadata

### Analysis Node
- Uses LLM to analyze retrieved content
- Extracts key findings and methodology
- Determines need for statistical analysis

### SciPy Computation Node
- Performs statistical analysis when needed
- Validates research claims with data
- Provides quantitative insights

### Decision Node
- Makes relevance judgments about documents
- Assigns confidence scores
- Uses both LLM and statistical evidence

### Report Generation Node
- Compiles comprehensive analysis reports
- Formats results for human review
- Includes methodology and evidence

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses GraphState TypedDict for consistent data flow
- Preserves intermediate results for debugging
- Enables checkpoint/resume functionality

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for missing data
- Detailed error logging and recovery
- Fallback strategies for failed operations

### LLM Integration
- Structured prompts for consistent results
- JSON output parsing with fallbacks
- Temperature control for reproducibility

## Node Features
- Async/await support for scalability
- Structured logging for observability
- Configurable parameters via environment

## Status
- [x] Node architecture designed
- [ ] nodes.py implemented
- [ ] LLM integration tested
- [ ] Error handling validated
