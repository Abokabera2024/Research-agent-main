# Stage 5: Text Chunking Implementation

## Overview
This stage implements intelligent text chunking to break down large documents into manageable pieces for processing and retrieval.

## Core Functionality

### Chunking Strategy
- Fixed-size chunking with configurable overlap
- Preserves context between chunks
- Optimized for vector embedding performance

### Chunk Management
- Unique chunk IDs for tracking
- Metadata preservation
- Efficient memory usage

## Implementation Details

### Chunking Parameters
- **chunk_size**: Default 1200 characters for optimal embedding performance
- **overlap**: Default 150 characters to maintain context
- **max_chunks**: Optional limit to prevent memory issues

### Chunk Structure
Each chunk contains:
- Document ID for traceability
- Unique chunk ID
- Text content
- Optional metadata

### Advanced Features
- Smart boundary detection (sentence/paragraph breaks)
- Content-aware chunking for scientific documents
- Handling of special characters and formatting

## Configuration Options
- Configurable chunk sizes for different document types
- Overlap adjustment based on content type
- Metadata enrichment options

## Status
- [x] Chunking strategy designed
- [ ] chunking.py implemented
- [ ] Boundary detection added
- [ ] Testing with various document types
